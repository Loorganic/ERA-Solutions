The === and !== operators are used to compare two values for equality or inequality, respectively. These operators are also known as "strict equality" and "strict inequality" operators.

**1. === (Strict Equality Operator):**
* It checks if both the value and the data type of the compared values are the same.
Returns true if the values and data types are equal, and false otherwise.

In this example, num1 is a number with a value of 5, and num2 is a string with the value "5". The === operator compares them, and since their data types are different (number vs. string), it returns false.

**1. !== (Strict Inequality Operator):**
* It checks if either the value or the data type of the compared values is different.
* Returns true if the values or data types are not equal, and false otherwise.

In this example, num1 is a number with a value of 10, and num2 is a string with the value "10". The !== operator compares them, and since their data types are different (number vs. string), it returns true.

Summary: 

* === is used to check for strict equality (both value and data type are the same).
* !== is used to check for strict inequality (either value or data type is different).

When comparing values in JavaScript, it is generally recommended to use the === and !== operators to avoid unexpected type conversions that may occur with the == and != operators. Using strict equality helps ensure more predictable and reliable comparisons.
