Let's say you're a commanding officer in the army, and you want to check the assigned mission for a soldier who has not yet been assigned any task. In this case, the status of the soldier's mission would be **"undefined" **because no specific mission has been given to them yet.

Similarly, in JavaScript, a variable that is undefined means that it has been declared but hasn't been assigned a value. It represents the absence of a defined value.

For example:

<img width="649" alt="Screenshot 2023-07-10 at 4 32 23 PM" src="https://github.com/ERA-Solutions-LLC/JavaScript-Intermediate-Assignments/assets/92329761/9123884b-d3ee-4ba4-94aa-c51b77f047a5">


In this example, the **mission **variable has been declared, but it hasn't been assigned a value. Therefore, when you try to print its value, it will be **undefined**.

**undefined** can occur in different scenarios, such as when a variable is declared but not assigned a value, or when you access an object property that doesn't exist. It acts as a default value indicating the absence of a specific value.

In programming, you may use conditional statements or error handling mechanisms to check if a value is **undefined** and take appropriate actions based on that information.

In summary, undefined in JavaScript represents the absence of a value. It is used when a variable has been declared but not assigned a value, or when accessing non-existent object properties. Just like in the army scenario, it signifies the absence of a specific mission assigned to a soldier.
