Dependencies help you leverage existing code created by other developers so you don't have to reinvent the wheel. 

Here's a simple breakdown:

1. Code Reusability: Imagine you want to build a website that displays a fancy slider. Instead of writing the code for the slider from scratch, you can use a ready-made slider library created by someone else. This library becomes a dependency for your project.

2. External Libraries: Dependencies are often JavaScript libraries or packages created by other developers and hosted on platforms like npm (Node Package Manager) for Node.js projects or CDNs (Content Delivery Networks) for browser-based projects.

3. Installation: To use a dependency in your project, you need to install it first. For example, if you're using npm, you would run a command like npm install package-name to add the dependency to your project.

4. Import/Require: After installation, you can import or require the dependency in your JavaScript code, allowing you to access the functions and features provided by the library.

5. Functionality Extension: Dependencies enable you to extend the capabilities of your JavaScript code without having to write everything yourself. You can incorporate complex features, like charts, maps, date pickers, etc., with just a few lines of code.

6. Maintainability: Using well-maintained dependencies can save you time and effort, as other developers maintain and update these libraries, fixing bugs and adding new features.
