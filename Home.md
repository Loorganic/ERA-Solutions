In [[computer programming]], a '''variable''' is an abstract storage location paired with an associated [[symbol|symbolic name]], which contains some known or unknown quantity of information referred to as a ''[[value (computer science)|value]]''; or in simpler terms, a variable is a named container for a particular set of bits or [[:simple:Data_type|type of data]] (like [[Integer (computer science)|integer]], [[Floating-point arithmetic|float]], [[String (computer science)|string]] etc...). A variable can eventually be associated with or identified by a [[memory address]]. The variable name is the usual way to [[Reference (computer science)|reference]] the stored value, in addition to referring to the variable itself, depending on the context. This separation of name and content allows the name to be used independently of the exact information it represents. The identifier in computer [[source code]] can be [[Name binding|bound]] to a [[Value (computer science)|value]] during [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|run time]], and the value of the variable may thus change during the course of [[Execution (computing)|program execution]].<ref>{{citation | title=[[Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools]] | pages=26–28}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Knuth |first=Donald |date=1997 |title=The Art of Computer Programming |volume=1 |edition=3rd |location=Reading, Massachusetts |publisher=Addison-Wesley |pages=3–4 |isbn=0-201-89683-4 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Programming with variables |url=https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/ap-computer-science-principles/programming-101/storing-variables/a/assigning-variables |website=Khan Academy |access-date=23 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Scratch for Budding Coders |url=https://cs.harvard.edu/malan/scratch/variables.php |publisher=Harvard |access-date=23 March 2020}}</ref>
