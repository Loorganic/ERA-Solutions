In [computer programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming), a variable is an abstract storage location paired with an associated [symbolic name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbol), which contains some known or unknown quantity of information referred to as a [value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(computer_science)); or in simpler terms, a variable is a named container for a particular set of bits or [type of data](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_type) (like [integer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_(computer_science)), [float](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic), [string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science)) etc...). A variable can eventually be associated with or identified by a [memory address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_address). The variable name is the usual way to [reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_(computer_science)) the stored value, in addition to referring to the variable itself, depending on the context. This separation of name and content allows the name to be used independently of the exact information it represents. The identifier in computer [source code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code) can be [bound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_binding) to a [value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(computer_science)) during [run time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_time_(program_lifecycle_phase)), and the value of the variable may thus change during the course of [program execution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Execution_(computing)).

Variables in programming may not directly correspond to the concept of [variables in mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)). The latter is [abstract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_and_concrete), having no reference to a physical object such as storage location. The value of a computing variable is not necessarily part of an [equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation) or [formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula) as in mathematics. Variables in computer programming are frequently given long names to make them relatively descriptive of their use, whereas variables in mathematics often have terse, one- or two-character names for brevity in transcription and manipulation.

A variable's storage location may be referenced by several different identifiers, a situation known as [aliasing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliasing_(computing)). Assigning a value to the variable using one of the identifiers will change the value that can be accessed through the other identifiers.

[Compilers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler_(computing)) have to replace variables' symbolic names with the actual locations of the data. While a variable's name, type, and location often remain fixed, the data stored in the location may be changed during program execution.
