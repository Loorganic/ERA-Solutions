In JavaScript, methods are functions that are associated with objects. They are functions that are defined as properties of an object and are used to perform actions or operations related to that object. Methods are an essential part of object-oriented programming (OOP) in JavaScript, as they enable objects to have behavior in addition to their properties.

When a function is defined as a property of an object, it is referred to as a method of that object. Methods can access the object's properties and modify them as needed. They can also perform computations, interact with other objects, or execute any other code necessary for the object to fulfill its purpose.

Here's an example of an object with methods:

In the example above, we have an object called **car**, which has properties like **brand**, **model**, and **year**. Additionally, it has two methods, **startEngine** and **accelerate**. These methods are functions that are defined within the object, and they are associated with the **car** object.

To call a method, you use the dot notation, where you specify the object's name followed by the method name and parentheses:

In the example above, we invoke the **startEngine** method and the **accelerate** method of the **car** object using the dot notation and passing appropriate arguments.

Methods allow objects to encapsulate their behavior, making it easy to organize code and maintain a clean and structured codebase. They also enable the concept of inheritance and polymorphism in object-oriented programming, where objects can share and override methods from their parent objects.
