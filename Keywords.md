In JavaScript, keywords are reserved words that have a specific meaning and purpose within the language. These words cannot be used as variable names, function names, or any other identifiers because they are already predefined with specific functionalities by the JavaScript language.

Keywords are an essential part of the language's syntax and play a crucial role in defining the structure and behavior of JavaScript code. They help define control structures, data types, function declarations, loops, conditionals, and other language constructs.

The following is a list of JavaScript keywords:

Please note that this list might change with newer ECMAScript (JavaScript) versions or updates. Additionally, some keywords are reserved for future use and might not have any functionality in the current version of JavaScript.

It's essential to be familiar with these keywords to write valid JavaScript code and to understand how the language works. Using keywords correctly will ensure that your code is syntactically and semantically accurate.
