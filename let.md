**let** is a keyword used to declare variables, just like var. The main difference between let and var lies in their scoping behavior.

Here's how you declare a variable using let:

Let's break it down:

1. **let**: This is the keyword we use to tell JavaScript that we want to create a new variable using block-scoping rules.
2. **age**: This is the name of the variable. You can choose any name you like, but it's a good practice to use descriptive names so you know what the variable represents.
3. **=**: This is the assignment operator. It's used to assign a value to the variable.
4. **25**: This is the value that we assigned to the variable age.

The key difference between let and var is how they handle variable scoping. When you use let, the variable is scoped to the block (a block is typically defined within curly braces {}) in which it is declared. This means that the variable is only accessible within that block and any nested blocks inside it.
