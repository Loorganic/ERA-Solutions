JavaScript has six primitive data types:

* **Number**: Represents numeric values, like **5** or **3.14**.
* **String**: Represents textual data, enclosed in single (') or double (") quotes, such as **"Hello, world!"**.
* **Boolean**: Represents either **true** or **false**, indicating logical values.
* **Null**: Represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is a special value denoted by the keyword **null**.
* **Undefined**: Represents an uninitialized or missing value. It is a special value denoted by the keyword **undefined**.
* **Symbol**: Represents unique and immutable values used as identifiers for object properties. Introduced in ECMAScript 6.

Primitives are simple, indivisible values, and they are not objects. Unlike objects, primitives do not have properties or methods associated with them. For example, you cannot call methods on a number like **5.toString()**, but you can do that with a number object like new **Number(5).toString()**.

Primitives are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed once they are created. However, you can assign new values to variables holding primitive values.
