**var** is a keyword used to declare variables. A variable is like a container where you can store data, such as numbers, text, or other types of information.

Here's how you declare a variable using **var**:

In this example, we declared a variable named age and assigned the value 25 to it. This means that the variable age now holds the value 25.

Let's break it down:

1. **var**: This is the keyword we use to tell JavaScript that we want to create a new variable.
2. **age**: This is the name of the variable. You can choose any name you like, but it's a good practice to use descriptive names so you know what the variable represents.
3. **=**: This is the assignment operator. It's used to assign a value to the variable.
4. **25**: This is the value that we assigned to the variable age.

After declaring the variable, you can use it in your code:

You can also change the value stored in a variable later in your code:

Just remember that var is one of several ways to declare variables in JavaScript, and it has some specific behaviors that you may want to be aware of. In modern JavaScript development, let and const are more commonly used for variable declarations, as they have more predictable scoping rules compared to var. However, understanding var can still be useful when you encounter older code or specific use cases.
