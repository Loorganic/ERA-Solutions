In JavaScript, properties are the characteristics or attributes of an object. They represent the data associated with the object and define its state. Objects are collections of key-value pairs, where each key is a property name, and each value is the data associated with that property.

For example, let's consider an object representing a person:

In this example, **name**, **age**, and **occupation** are properties of the **person** object. Each property has a name (also known as a key) and a corresponding value. The properties represent different characteristics of the person, such as their name, age, and occupation.

You can access the values of object properties using dot notation or square brackets:

In the example above, we added a new property **location** and modified the **age** property of the **person** object.

Properties can have different data types, including strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, other objects, and even functions. When a property contains a function, it is often referred to as a method, as mentioned in the previous answer.

Objects and their properties are fundamental in JavaScript and play a significant role in organizing and representing data in applications. They provide a flexible and powerful way to store and access data, making JavaScript a versatile and widely-used language for various programming tasks.
