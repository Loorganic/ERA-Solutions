A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task or calculates a value. Functions are an essential concept in programming, as they allow developers to break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable pieces of code, promoting code reusability and organization.

A function in JavaScript can be defined using the function keyword, followed by a function name (identifier), a list of parameters (optional), and the function body enclosed in curly braces {}. The parameters represent values that can be passed to the function when it is called, and the function body contains the code that will be executed when the function is invoked.

Here's the basic syntax of a JavaScript function:

For example, let's create a simple function that adds two

numbers and returns the result:

In the above function:

* **addNumbers** is the function name.
* **num1** and **num2** are the parameters of the function.
* The function body calculates the sum of the two parameters (**num1** and **num2**) and stores the result in the **sum** variable.
* The function then uses the return keyword to send the calculated sum back as the function's output.
* Once a function is defined, it can be called (invoked) by using its name followed by parentheses (), and passing any required arguments inside the parentheses.

For example:

<img width="324" alt="Screenshot 2023-07-21 at 2 01 43 AM" src="https://github.com/ERA-Solutions-LLC/JavaScript-Intermediate-Assignments/assets/92329761/f3d98e28-a812-4fc6-931c-4bea4adc20b4">


In this example, we call the **addNumbers** function with the arguments **5** and **3**, and it returns **8**, which is then stored in the result variable and printed to the console.

Functions are a fundamental building block of JavaScript and other programming languages. They allow developers to create modular and organized code, making it easier to manage and maintain complex applications. Functions are used extensively in JavaScript for a wide range of tasks, from simple calculations to complex application logic and event handling.
