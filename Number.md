Numbers can be positive or negative. For example, **-10** and **7** are both valid numbers.

JavaScript provides several operators for performing mathematical operations with numbers, such as addition **(+)**, subtraction **(-)**, multiplication **(*)**, and division **(/)**.

JavaScript also supports more advanced mathematical operations like exponentiation **(**)** and modulo (remainder) operation **(%)**.
It's important to note that JavaScript treats numbers as a single data type, regardless of whether they are integers or floating-point numbers. This means that you can perform calculations with different types of numbers without worrying about their specific type.

For example, you can add an integer and a floating-point number together:
