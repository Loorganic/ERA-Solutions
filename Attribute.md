In JavaScript, an attribute is a piece of additional information that can be attached to an HTML element. It helps to provide extra details about the element, making it more dynamic and interactive. Attributes are written as key-value pairs and are defined within the start tag of an HTML element.

Adding a "src" attribute to an Image Element:

<img width="477" alt="Screenshot 2023-07-24 at 11 57 08 AM" src="https://github.com/ERA-Solutions-LLC/JavaScript-Intermediate-Assignments/assets/92329761/f8d5917b-1895-41f5-b7c2-0fcd696fc52e">

In this example, the "src" attribute is added to an "img" element to specify the image's source file. The "src" attribute's value is "image.jpg," which tells the browser where to find the image to display on the webpage.

Using the "href" Attribute for a Link:

Here, the "href" attribute is applied to an "a" (anchor) element to create a hyperlink. The "href" attribute's value is "https://www.example.com/," which defines the destination URL the user will be directed to when they click on the link.

Setting an "onclick" Attribute for a Button:

<img width="460" alt="Screenshot 2023-07-24 at 11 57 22 AM" src="https://github.com/ERA-Solutions-LLC/JavaScript-Intermediate-Assignments/assets/92329761/90a53092-6d31-4cf4-aa5e-69aa07e5983b">

In this case, the "onclick" attribute is used in a "button" element to specify the JavaScript function "showMessage()" that should be executed when the button is clicked. The "onclick" attribute's value is the function call, allowing you to perform actions like showing a message or triggering other functions.

Using Custom Attributes:

Custom attributes are used when you need to store custom data for an element. In this example, the "data-user" and "data-age" attributes are created for a "div" element. The attributes start with "data-" and can hold any information you want. You can access this data later using JavaScript.

JavaScript can interact with these attributes to change their values or retrieve data from them, making it possible to create dynamic and interactive web pages.
