You're a military commander, and you want to assign unique identification symbols to each unit under your command. You design custom symbols, such as emblems or patches, for each unit. These symbols are unique to each unit and serve as distinct identifiers.

Similarly, in JavaScript, a symbol is a special data type that represents a unique identifier. It's often used as a property key in objects to ensure uniqueness.

For example:

<img width="649" alt="Screenshot 2023-07-10 at 5 23 59 PM" src="https://github.com/ERA-Solutions-LLC/JavaScript-Intermediate-Assignments/assets/92329761/c31ca469-f3c0-4ad6-8c05-4183d6d87959">

In this example, we use symbols (**unit1Symbol** and **unit2Symbol**) as property keys in the armyUnits object. Each symbol represents a distinct identifier for a specific army unit. By using symbols, we ensure that the keys are unique, even if their string representations are the same.

Symbols are unique and immutable, meaning that once created, they cannot be changed. This uniqueness helps avoid accidental property name collisions when working with objects.

In summary, a symbol in JavaScript is a unique and immutable value that can be used as an identifier for object properties. It's like having custom symbols or emblems for army units, ensuring distinct identification. Symbols are often used to prevent naming conflicts and provide uniqueness in object properties.
