A const is a way to declare a variable that cannot be reassigned once it's given a value. It's like creating a box and putting something inside it. Once you put something in the box, you can't replace it with something else.

Here's a simple example:

In this example, we declare a constant variable named pi and assign it the value 3.14. Now, pi will always be 3.14, and you can't change it to another value later in your code.

If you try to reassign a value to a const variable, you'll get an error:
