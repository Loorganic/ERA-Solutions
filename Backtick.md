A backtick, also known as a grave accent, is a special character in JavaScript (and many other programming languages) that is represented by the symbol **`**. It is not to be confused with a regular single quote (') or double quote (").

In JavaScript, backticks are used to create template literals, which are a convenient way to work with strings that span multiple lines or include variables within them. Template literals allow you to embed expressions and variables directly into the string, making string interpolation much simpler and more readable.

Here is an example of a template literal:

Output:

As you can see, the backticks allow us to include variables (${name} and ${age}) directly within the string, enclosed by ${}. This way, we can create dynamic strings without the need for concatenation or escaping new lines manually.

Template literals provide a concise and elegant way to work with strings in JavaScript, making code more readable and maintainable, especially when dealing with complex strings that involve multiple variables or line breaks.
