The "!" or "not" operator in JavaScript is a logical operator used to perform negation or inversion of a boolean value. A boolean value can only be either true or false. When the "!" operator is placed before a boolean expression, it reverses the value of that expression. If the expression is true, it becomes false, and if the expression is false, it becomes true.
