JSON, which stands for "JavaScript Object Notation," is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is widely used as a data format for transmitting data between a server and a web application, as well as for storing and exchanging data in various programming contexts.

JSON is based on a subset of the JavaScript programming language, but it is language-independent. This means that JSON data can be understood and used by many programming languages, not just JavaScript.

JSON data is represented in key-value pairs and is often structured in two primary data structures:

**1. Objects:** An object in JSON is a collection of key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces {}. Each key is a string, and each value can be a string, number, boolean, null, another JSON object, or an array.

**2. Arrays:** An array in JSON is an ordered list of values enclosed in square brackets []. Each element in the array can be a string, number, boolean, null, another JSON object, or another array.

JSON is widely used in web development to exchange data between the server and the client as it provides a simple and standardized way to structure data. It is also used for configuration files, APIs, and as a data storage format for various applications. JSON's human-readable format and its ease of parsing and generation have made it a popular choice for data interchange in modern software development.
