Template literals, also known as template strings, are a feature introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) that allows for more flexible and readable string handling in JavaScript. They are enclosed by backticks (`) instead of single quotes ('') or double quotes ("").

Template literals offer several advantages over traditional strings:

String Interpolation: Template literals allow you to embed expressions and variables directly into the string using ${} syntax. This is called string interpolation, and it simplifies the process of combining variables and text.

Multi-line Strings: With template literals, you can create strings that span multiple lines without the need for escape characters or concatenation. The line breaks are preserved exactly as they are in the template literal.

Expression Evaluation: The expressions inside ${} are evaluated, allowing you to perform calculations, call functions, or use any valid JavaScript expression within the template.

Here are some examples to illustrate these features:

Template literals provide a cleaner and more elegant way to work with strings in JavaScript, especially when dealing with dynamic content, complex expressions, or multiline text. They are widely used in modern JavaScript development to improve code readability and maintainability.
